# The mash plan

The Brautomat works with a tabular mashing plan. This plan is processed line by line from top to bottom. Each line represents a mash step. The properties of a mash step are shown in the columns of each row.

The mash plan also includes wort boiling steps, hop additions and additives.

It is recommended that beginners read the _Mash Plan_ chapter before the first day of brewing. Almost all functions are intuitively understandable. But there are also less obvious functions.
