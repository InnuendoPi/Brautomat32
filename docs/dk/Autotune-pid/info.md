# AutoTune PID

A separate PID AutoTune library InnuAPID was developed for the Brautomat. The starting point was the Arduino PID library [Brett Beauregard](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library), as well as the addons AutoTune and PIDBoil for CraftbeerPi.

The PID control has the task of generating and maintaining a constant mash temperature, regardless of the boiler volume or the type of heat energy supply.
