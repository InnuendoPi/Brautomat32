# MQTTDevice

The Brautomat is a standalone controller and cannot communicate with a second Brautomat or CraftBeerPi4. A RaspberryPi, a Docker container or another Python3 environment is not required. The Brautomat focuses on simple, intuitive and affordable.\
The hardware (ESP, temperature sensors, display, GGM IDS2) and the circuit board are identical in both projects. A switch between the firmwares Brautomat and MQTTDevice is possible at any time without making any changes. The [MQTTDevice](https://github.com/InnuendoPi/MQTTDevice32pIO) is used with CraftBeerPi4.
