# Basic setup

The Brautomat requires at least one temperature sensor and either a GGM IDS induction hob or a relay-controlled hob. In the following basic setting, only the required parameters are configured, while optional settings are explained later.  

The basic setting is explained using the GGM IDS2 induction hob. For a relay-controlled hob, the configuration is analogous.  

This basic setting describes a brewing system with a mash brew kettle. Setting up additional boilers (e.g. brewing or HLT boilers) follows the same principle.
