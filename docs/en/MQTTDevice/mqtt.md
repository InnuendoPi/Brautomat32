# MQTTDevice

The Brautomat is a stand-alone controller and cannot communicate with a second Brautomat or CraftBeerPi4. A RaspberryPi, a Docker container or another Python3 environment is not required. The Brautomat focuses on simple, intuitive and inexpensive.\
The hardware (ESP, temperature sensors, display, GGM IDS2) and the circuit board are identical in both projects. It is possible to switch between the Brautomat and MQTTDevice firmwares at any time without making any changes. The [MQTTDevice](https://github.com/InnuendoPi/MQTTDevice32pIO) is used with CraftBeerPi4.
