# Button functions

## Description of all buttons

The mash plan provides buttons for editing, moving, saving and deleting steps.

### Save (table)

The green save button in the header saves the current mash plan as a JSON file.

### Reload/Update

The reload button reloads the mash plan from the file. Changes that are not saved will be discarded.

### Exit (Editor)

With Exit the line editor is left without applying the changes.

### Delete (table)

The delete button empties the entire mash plan. This change will only be permanently applied when you save it.

### Plus button

A new line is added with plus. The line is first saved in the table (blue save symbol in the line) and then saved permanently using the green save button.

### Graph button

The graph button shows or hides the temperature curve. Individual curves can be selected and deselected using the legend.

Tip: If you want to hide the graphic permanently, hide it and then save the system settings once.

### Mash plan settings (database button)

The functions for mash plan name, change, import, export and deletion of mash plans are located here.

Note: The previous time control (timed brew start) is not included in 1.60.

### Collapse mash plan

Shows or hides the mash plan table. This saves space on small displays while brewing.

### Collapse Chart

Shows or hides the chart. The diagram continues to be updated even when collapsed.
