# HLT sparge water

The Brautomat offers the option of configuring a ‘boiler’ for post-pouring. The after-pour can be a simple kettle, for example. The configuration is identical to that described for the basic setting.

A new configuration parameter ‘Invert GPIO’ is offered for post-casting and also for the configuration of actors. GPIOs can be set to HIGH by default when the Wemo is switched on. HIGH means ‘current is flowing’. Accordingly, LOW means that no current is flowing. The factory setting of the Wemo and the general understanding of an On/Off switch would therefore be that all GPIOS (switches) are set to On when the Wemo is switched on. Invert GPIO reverses the factory setting.
