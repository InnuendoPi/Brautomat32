# Basic setup

Brautomat requires at least one temperature sensor and either a GGM IDS induction cooker or a relay-controlled heater. In this basic setup, only the required parameters are configured. Optional settings are explained in later chapters.  

This section uses a GGM IDS2 as the example device. For relay-based setups, the workflow is basically the same.  

This basic setup describes one mash kettle. Additional kettles (for example boil kettle or HLT/NACHGUSS) are configured the same way.
