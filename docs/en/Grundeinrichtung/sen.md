## Assigning a sensor address and name

Temperature sensors of type Dallas DS18B20 have a unique address, which the firmware uses for identification. This address can be selected from the dropdown list.

If no sensor is detected:

* Click the Reload button to restart sensor detection.
* If the sensor still does not appear, check the cable connection.

Each sensor also requires a name to differentiate it from others. In this basic setup, the sensor is named "Sensor IDS2".

_Note: Sensor names can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The special characters # and spaces are allowed. The web interface automatically validates the input._

## Sensor Calibration (Offset Values)

The Offset 1 and Offset 2 properties are used for sensor calibration. A detailed explanation is provided in the "Sensors â€“ Calibration" section. For this basic setup, both values remain unchanged at 0.00.

## Saving and Verifying the Sensor

Click "Save Sensor" to add the sensor. It will then be displayed in the "Sensors" section of the dashboard.

The configuration process for analog PT100x sensors follows the same steps but is not covered in this basic setup.
