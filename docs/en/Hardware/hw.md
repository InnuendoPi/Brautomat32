## Examples of actors

### Pumps

A pump is a great help when lautering or transporting into the fermentation tank. The pump used must be food-safe and suitable for temperatures up to 100°C. The mini pumps from Rotekt are very suitable for use in the brewing kitchen:

Connections with [Camlocks from Braubebo](https://www.braubebo.de/camlock/) as shown in the first picture are also very good and fast.

### SSR Solid State Relay

SSRs can be switched very easily with the Brautomat. SSRs or solid state relays switch the 220V AC circuit on or off with 3-5V direct current from the Brautomat. The Fotek SSRs are ideal for temperature regulation and control via the Brautomat.

Application examples for SSR: If 220V is connected to an SSR Fotek via the Brautomat, a socket for any device with a plug can be fitted at the “other end” of the 220V cable. For example, for the power supply unit of the stirrer. Or for a post-casting boiler. Or for a ring heating element. The power supply unit of the Rotek pump can also be switched on and off via an SSR.

### Relay modul

Not all consumers require a powerful SSR. For example, actors such as agitators or pumps can be switched with inexpensive relay boards. A very good relay board is the Keenso 4-channel optocoupler relay board.

### Ring heating elements

A ring heating element is useful when boiling the wort if the output of the main hob is no longer sufficient or only just sufficient to boil the wort to a boil. A good selection of ring heating elements is available from [Douglas Crafthardware](https://www.crafthardware.de/products/ringheizelement-3-5-kw-fuer-45-cm-kessel).
