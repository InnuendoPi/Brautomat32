# The Dashboard

![Dashboard](/docs/img/dashboard160.jpg)

Dashboard mode is optimized for brew day. Once kettles, actuators, and sensors are configured, it combines the most relevant controls and status information in one view.

## Enable dashboard

Enable Dashboard in system settings:

Depending on your setup, you can choose which modules should appear in Dashboard.

* Configuration blocks for sensors/actuators/kettles can be hidden.
* Runtime control elements stay available in Dashboard.

## Using dashboard

When brewing starts, the UI automatically switches to dashboard-oriented layout:

* mash plan table is collapsed
* active mash step is shown above controls
* next mash step is shown above the chart
* next-step state reflects `autonext` (green/red indicator)

You can reopen the mash plan at any time with the collapse button. During pause, the mash plan is also opened automatically. Hidden modules can still be re-enabled later in system settings.
