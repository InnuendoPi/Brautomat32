The Dashboard is used in brewing. As soon as hobs, actuators and sensors are configured, the Dashboard combines all important information in one place.

## Activate Dashboard.

The Dashboard is activated in the system settings:

Depending on the existing configuration, boilers, actuators and sensors can be displayed in Dashboard. The web interface of Brautomat can be reduced in size using the selection shown in the image:

* The elements for configuring hobs, actuators and sensors are deactivated
* The elements of hobs, actuators and sensors are activated in Dashboard.

## Use Dashboard.

If the Dashboard is activated, the Brautomat automatically changes its appearance when a brewing process is started:

* the mash plan is automatically collapsed
* The active mash step is displayed above the controller Deck.
* The next mash step is displayed above the temperature curve graphic
* the next mash step is displayed with a red or green symbol depending on autonext.

All elements for controlling hobs and actuators remain in the Dashboard. The mash plan can be opened again at any time using the collapse button. If the pause button is clicked, the mash plan is automatically opened. Hidden elements can also be shown again during a brewing process via the system settings.
